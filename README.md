# YouTube Comment Sentiment Analysis using NLP (VADER & TextBlob)

This project analyzes YouTube comments using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to understand the overall sentiment of viewers using two models: **VADER** and **TextBlob**.

---

##  Project Highlights
- Scrapes real-time YouTube comments using `youtube-comment-downloader`
- Cleans and preprocesses text (including an alternate version with minimal cleaning)
- Applies VADER and TextBlob for sentiment scoring
- Visualizes sentiment distribution and most common words via a Word Cloud

---

##  Libraries Used
- `nltk`, `textblob`, `vaderSentiment`
- `pandas`, `re`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `wordcloud`
- `youtube-comment-downloader`

---

## Key Learning
This project helped me understand:
- The importance of text preprocessing
- How over-cleaning can negatively impact sentiment detection
- The difference between rule-based (VADER) and lexicon-based (TextBlob) models
